Google Chrome Plugin for ComponentJS Development Support

Status
------

ATTENTION: WORK IN PROGRESS -- STILL NOT FUNCTIONAL!

Overview
--------

This is a plugin (aka extension) for the 
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) browser to
support development with [ComponentJS](http://componentjs.com/),
the powerful Component System for hierarchically structuring the
User-Interface (UI) dialogs of complex HTML5-based Rich Clients (aka
Single-Page-Apps).

Installation
------------

1. Download and install Google Chrome:
   https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/
2. Open the extension page by going to the URL "chrome://extensions"
   or by manually entering it via "Menu > Tools > Extensions"<br/>
3. Ensure that the "Developer Mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." at the top left-hand corner and use the 
   file-selection dialog to locate and select the directory of this
   extension (the directory where this README file is located).
5. You find the functionality once you open the "Google Chrome Inspector"
   (for instance via "Menu > Tools > Developer Tools") on the tab "ComponentJS".
